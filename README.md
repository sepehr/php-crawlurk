# Crawlurk Framework
Crawlurk is a modular and multi-process crawler framework for PHP. Actually it's a slim wrapper around the awesome [PHPCrawl](http://phpcrawl.cuab.de) library. Even though that it's a good kickstart point for most of PHP crawling projects, this repo is for my own personal usage. So there will be no documentation, no nothing.
