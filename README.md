# Modular and Multi-process Crawler Framework for PHP
Even though that it's a good kickstart point for most of PHP crawling projects, this repo is for my own personal usage. So there will be no documentation, no nothing.

### Licensing
Note that this repo contains external libraries in `vendor/` with probably different licensings. But anything else is licensed under **WTFPL**, so _"you just do what the fuck you want to"_.
